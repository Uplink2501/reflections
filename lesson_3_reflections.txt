When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remotes allow multiple contributors from multiple sources to work on the same shared reference material.
  Even a single contributor benefits by interacting with a master copy from any computer having a browser or having Git installed.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  A remote may allow updates from other contributors, so a manual pull is preferred in order to maintain reliable and consistent local version.
