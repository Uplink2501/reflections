When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remotes allow multiple contributors from multiple sources to work on the same shared reference material.
  Even a single contributor benefits by interacting with a master copy from any computer having a browser or having Git installed.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  A remote may allow updates from other contributors, so a manual pull is preferred in order to maintain reliable and consistent local version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
  A fork is a clone performed from GitHub to GitHub. Use when building upon others works to offer due credit.
  A clone is a working copy of commits from a repository. Use when contributing to said repository.
  A branch is tracked directory for parallel code to reside (as working copy, or as easy referenced version).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  It allows the possibility to work offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  Directly with contributors/reviewers, using a shared folder (with restricted permissions) or a CMS, and manually reviewing differences.
  I'm curious to know how projects with a large number of contributors (and subsequent comments suggestions etc) are managed.
  It seems that even simple changes benefit from a track record and consistent workflow.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?
