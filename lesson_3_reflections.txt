When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remotes allow multiple contributors from multiple sources to work on the same shared reference material.
  Even a single contributor benefits by interacting with a master copy from any computer having a browser or having Git installed.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  A remote may allow updates from other contributors, so a manual pull is preferred in order to maintain reliable and consistent local version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
  A fork is a clone performed from GitHub to GitHub. Use when building upon others works to offer due credit.
  A clone is a working copy of commits from a repository. Use when contributing to said repository.
  A branch is tracked directory for parallel code to reside (as working copy, or as easy referenced version).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
